<!-- In the provided code, the bind() method is used to ensure that the this value inside the handleClick method refers
    to the instance of the React class (app object) when the button is clicked. This is necessary because event listeners
    in JavaScript execute the callback function with the this value set to the target element that triggered the event. 
    By using bind(this), you're explicitly setting the this value to the instance of the React class.

    Without using bind(this), the this value inside handleClick would refer to the button element, not the instance of the React class.
    By using bind(this), you ensure that this inside handleClick is the instance of the React class, allowing you to access properties
    like this.server.-->
